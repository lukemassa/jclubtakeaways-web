Current setup:
- jclubtakeaways-api: Deployed via Heroku (needed to get a token, called via js)
- jclubtakeaways-gui: Builds for github app
- jclubtakeaways-gui-dev: Some kind of dev version?

Goal setup:
- This repo deploys a heroku app that just gets the token when asked
- This repo also deploys, via github actions + github pages, static content
- No "dev", just run locally if you want to develop

Code:
- Handle commit.txt
- Use embed to load all files
- Detect issues w missing API token early
- Maybe don't save docs/ ?

Deploy:
- Create heroku dev app, deploy from github action on push to `development`
- Create heroku prd app, deploy from github action on push to `main`
- Move jclubtakeaways.com to this new URL
- Write up docs explaining how to do it
- Archive old repos
- Delete old heroku app

Follow ups:
- Add favicon
- Add README
